## Malicious traffic to Sentinel LAW. ##

### I hope I caught your attention with the title.  Now that I have your attention, how do we capture the "bad" traffic hitting our environment.  We do this by creating an NSG (network security group) Flow Log to [Traffic Analyitcs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/traffic-analytics-policy-portal) and send them off to Sentinel.###
