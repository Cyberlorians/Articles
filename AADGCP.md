## Azure Active Directory & Google Cloud Platform - Identity Governance. ##

The biggest hurdle in most organizations comes down to managing the Identity Goverance aspect. Over my career, I have worked for many outfits that have multiple identities, when it was easily not needed. Fast foward to today, I am not only seeing multiple traditional Active Directory infrastructures, as well as, multiple cloud platforms. I.e., CompanyA has traditional Active Directory Domain Services in hybrid with Azure Active Directory but their AWS (Amazon Web Services) and GCP (Google Cloud Platform) cloud providers are separated and under an entirely different management realm outside of the identity teams purview and organizations life cycle. The scenario I just described can be spun a few ways but it all comes down to consolidating into one identity platform. 

Executive Order [M-22-09](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf) has it summed in a paragraph: "Using centrally managed systems to provide enterprise identity and access management 
services reduces the burden on agency staff to manage individual accounts and credentials. It 
also improves agenciesâ€™ knowledge of user activities, thereby enabling better detection of 
anomalous behavior, allowing agencies to more uniformly enforce security policies that limit 
access, as well as quickly detect and take action against anomalous behavior when needed.".
