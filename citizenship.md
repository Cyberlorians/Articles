![](https://github.com/Cyberlorians/uploadedimages/blob/main/citizen09.png)
4. Connect to PowerShell (either on the client endpoint or via Azure CLI PowerShell).
5. Enter the following code to assign the required Microsoft Graph permissions:

    ```powershell
    # Install Microsoft Graph module if not already available
    if (-not (Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name Microsoft.Graph.Authentication)) {
        Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -Scope CurrentUser -Force
    }
    Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication
    # Connect to Microsoft Graph using device authentication - Commercial & GCC Environment
    Connect-MgGraph -Scopes Application.Read.All, AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All -UseDeviceAuthentication

    # Connect to Microsoft Graph using device authentication - GCCH - Uncomment Next Line
    # Connect-MgGraph -Scopes Application.Read.All, AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All -Environment USGov -UseDeviceAuthentication

    # Define the name of the Managed Identity
    $miName = "CitizenshipVerification_LA"
    Write-Host "Searching for Managed Identity: $miName..."

    # Attempt to retrieve the Managed Identity
    $managedIdentity = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "displayName eq '$miName'"

    # Fallback: Ask for ObjectId if not found
    if ($null -eq $managedIdentity) {
        $miObjectId = Read-Host -Prompt "Managed Identity not found. Enter ObjectId manually:"
    } else {
        $miObjectId = $managedIdentity.Id
    }

    # Microsoft Graph application ID
    $appId = "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"

    # Define required permissions to assign
    $permissionsToAdd = @("User.ReadWrite.All")

    # Get the Microsoft Graph service principal
    $graphSp = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$appId'"

    # Assign each required permission to the Managed Identity
    foreach ($permission in $permissionsToAdd) {
        Write-Host "Assigning: $permission"

        # Find the matching AppRole
        $role = $graphSp.AppRoles | Where-Object { $_.Value -eq $permission } | Select-Object -First 1

        # Build assignment parameters
        $params = @{
            PrincipalId       = $miObjectId
            ResourceId        = $graphSp.Id
            AppRoleId         = $role.Id
        }

        # Create the app role assignment
        New-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignment -ServicePrincipalId $miObjectId -BodyParameter $params
    }

    # Disconnect from Microsoft Graph
    Disconnect-MgGraph
    ```
3. Your setup should look similar to the example below:  Permissions should be set.

### üèóÔ∏è Step 10: Create an Access Package and Configure Request Information

1. Go to the **Access Packages** section.
2. Click **+ New Access Package**.
3. Fill in the required details for the access package (name, description, etc.).
4. Under **Request Information**, configure the settings as shown in the screenshot below:

üéâ **You‚Äôre all set for this step!**  
Next, you‚Äôll continue building out your Logic App and set permissions as needed.
